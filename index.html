            Hi, I'm Patrick Kyaio, but everyone calls me Patch! <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/383-waving-hand-1.svg/800px-383-waving-hand-1.svg.png" width="60px"/>
          </h1>
          <p>
            I am a wild and wonderful weirdo full of random information that I am attempting to assemble into some form of employable toolbox.
            I have worked as a low grade IT professional for years and served as CTO for an education and professional development training company, maintaining and developing their web presence and tools.
            I have worked on websites and functionalities pertaining to virtual learning and video conferencing, as well as memberships, e-commerce, and forum integrations.
            I am now back into my education to develop my toolkit in more depth in terms of programming languages and full stack concepts, and am excited at what the future holds.

          Patch is an organic cyborg born on planet Omikron Perseii 8.
          He has a very strange mind, so dont look too deep or you may become confused. 
          He takes criticism very well and it seems to make him literally grow in size, to the tune of about 4 inches and 12 pounds per critique.

          Working with Patch has been an experience. 
          He has a tendency to beep rapidly when his battery is low. 
          For any future projects that need his expertise, I would use him, lest we suffer the wrath of his constant beatboxing that occurs when he is sad.

          <span>&#8220;</span>
          I had worked along with Patch during the initial phase of our venture which needed cereal box navigation. 
          He is a valuable resource, as long as you understand how to operate within his unique parameters. 
          He will be an asset for any organism, provided you allow him to assimilate into your organic structure!
